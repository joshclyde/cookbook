# Cookbook using Nuxt 3

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Backlog

- make home page a bit prettier
- scroll over step in directions will highlight ingredients used
- ingredients sectioned out (for the chicken, ..., for the sauce, ...)
- linking recipes
  - for example, i have some recipe that wants me to make some guac and i already have a guac recipe. so instead of duplicating the recipe i can link the recipe to my guac recipe
- allow for optional ratings (when recipe is new))
- naming timers
- redesign timers to be on side (if it looks good)
- cooking mode
  - so, have 2 different views of the site. one view has all the recipes that are nice for us to browse. the second view is more condensed and built for ease of use when cooking. some differences could be that you don't need to see timers when just browing, and when cooking you don't need to see the ratings
