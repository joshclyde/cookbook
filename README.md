# Cookbook using Nuxt 3

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Backlog

- scroll over step in directions will highlight ingredients used
- ingredients sectioned out (for the chicken, ..., for the sauce, ...)
- linking recipes
  - for example, i have some recipe that wants me to make some guac and i already have a guac recipe. so instead of duplicating the recipe i can link the recipe to my guac recipe
- allow for optional ratings (when recipe is new))
